# Stage 2 - Meteor Official Tutorial

## Goal

Understand the overall process of building a Meteor app by following [the official Meteor tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app) and creating the sample To-Do app. 

## Submission

- Branch from `meteor-tutorial-todo-app` and name the new branch `"meteor-tutorial-todo-app__<name>"` where `<name>` is your name.
- Follow the tutorial exactly as it says, at first.
- Make sure to name the new app `"simple-todos"` as the tutorial says.
- For most part the tutorial should already have links to resources that you can expand on. If you find any part confusing or couldnâ€™t find an explaination **even after some googling**, feel free to ask in the #training channel.
- Make sure to commit after finishing each step. Especially the last one.
- If you have time, try fiddling with the code (after you have commited) and see what interesting changes/features you can make.
